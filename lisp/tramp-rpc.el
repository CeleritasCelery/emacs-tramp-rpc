;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a TRAMP backend that uses a custom RPC server
;; instead of parsing shell command output.  This significantly improves
;; performance for remote file operations.
;;
;; Once installed, just access files using the "rpc" method:
;;   /rpc:user@host:/path/to/file
;;
;; The package autoloads automatically - no (require 'tramp-rpc) needed.
;;
;; FEATURES:
;; - Fast file operations via binary RPC protocol
;; - Async process support (make-process, start-file-process)
;; - VC mode integration works (git, etc.)
;;
;; HOW ASYNC PROCESSES WORK:
;; Remote processes are started via RPC and polled periodically for output.
;; A local pipe process serves as a relay to provide Emacs process semantics.
;; Process filters, sentinels, and signals all work as expected.
;;
;; OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION:
;; If you experience issues with diff-hl in Dired, you can disable it:
;;   (setq diff-hl-disable-on-remote t)
;;
;; AUTHENTICATION:
;; When ControlMaster is enabled (default), tramp-rpc establishes the SSH
;; ControlMaster connection first, which supports both key-based and password
;; authentication.  If your SSH key isn't available, you'll be prompted for
;; a password.  Subsequent operations reuse this connection without prompting.

  ;; Give the rpc method all ssh connection parameters so it can serve
  ;; as a hop in tramp-sh multi-hop chains.  This matters in two ways:
  ;; - /rpc:host|sudo:root@host:/path is claimed by the tramp-rpc
  ;;   foreign handler (see `tramp-rpc--sudo-file-name-p'), which never
  ;;   uses these parameters for login.
  ;; - Chains ending in shell-based methods such as su or docker, e.g.
  ;;   /rpc:host|su::/path or /rpc:host|docker:container:/path, are
  ;;   handled by tramp-sh, which logs in through the rpc hop as if it
  ;;   were ssh (issue #99).  That happens without ever loading
  ;;   tramp-rpc.el, so the full parameter set must be installed here at
  ;;   autoload time, not when the main file is loaded.  RPC-to-RPC
  ;;   chains remain RPC-backed.
  ;; This is future-proof: if ssh's parameters change in future TRAMP
  ;; versions, rpc automatically inherits the updates.
