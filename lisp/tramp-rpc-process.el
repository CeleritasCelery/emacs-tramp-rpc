;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides async (pipe) and PTY process support for tramp-rpc.
;; It handles:
;; - Starting remote processes (pipe and PTY modes)
;; - Async callback-based I/O for pipe processes (used by LSP, compilation)
;; - PTY process support via direct SSH or RPC
;; - Terminal resize handling for vterm/eat/shell-mode
;; - Process write queuing and serialization
;; - Adaptive poll-based I/O fallback
